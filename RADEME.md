The final report is generated by makefile rules and corresponding R
scripts.

The report contains the 6 tables and 2 plots and corresponding
descriptions.

All the tables are generated by code/tables.R and all the plots are
generated by code/plots.R

The whole process will take a while because of the large data set.
