The final report is generated by makefile rules and corresponding R
scripts.

Please run the command below in terminal to generate the report
automatically.

``` terminal
make report.html
```

The report contains the 6 tables and 2 plots and corresponding
descriptions.

All the tables are generated by code/tables.R and all the plots are
generated by code/plots.R

The whole process will take a while because of the large data set.
